# Pose Fitter
Counts pushup currently from video input



##*Working*
Based on angles calculates the direction of movement and contraints and when both directions have been checked the count increases.

##*Errors and shortcomings*
  
  1.Hard coded angles : Difficult to be set up by non technical person.  
Improvement might be automatic angle constraints checker  
  
  2.Angles based on single video: The angles have been taken from 2 videos   
for left and right side push ups grown adults. If a child performs exercise erronous result is given.  
  
  3.No horizontal or vertical position checking: If a persons movements satisfy   
the angle constraints no matter they are standing or doing it properly,  
it would show as proper pushup.
